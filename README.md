## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

[React Native environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) on your machine.

### Setup

1. Fork this repo in your own GitHub account
2. Clone the forked repo to your local machine
3. Run `pnpm install` to install all dependencies in the project
4. For Android:
   ```
   pnpm android
   ```
   For iOS:
   ```
   pnpm ios

## Instructions

This is the boilerplate that [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red) uses as a way to test bleeding-edge changes to our React Native stack.

Currently includes:

- React Native
- React Navigation
- MobX State Tree
- TypeScript
- And [more!](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite?tab=readme-ov-file#tech-stack)

### Comes with Built-in generators

### Component generator

This is the generator you will be using most often. They come pre-wrapped with mobx-react-lite's observer function, which you'll need to trigger re-renders if any MobX-State-Tree properties that are being used in this component change.

```
npx ignite-cli generate component MyAwesomeButton
```

- Creates the component/function

### Screen generator

Generates a "hooks enabled" screen that is also pre-wrapped with mobx-react-lite's observer function, making it automatically re-render anytime a relevant MST property changes.

```
npx ignite-cli generate screen Settings
```

### Model generator

Creates a Mobx-State-Tree model.

```
npx ignite-cli generate model Pizza
```

- Creates the model
- Creates a unit test file
- Appends export to `models/index.ts` unless you pass `--skip-index-file`

### ./app directory

Included in an Ignite boilerplate project is the `app` directory. This is a directory you would normally have to create when using vanilla React Native.

The inside of the `app` directory looks similar to the following:

```
app
├── components
├── config
├── i18n
├── models
├── navigators
├── screens
├── services
├── theme
├── utils
└── app.tsx
```

**components**
This is where your reusable components live which help you build your screens.

**i18n**
This is where your translations will live if you are using `react-native-i18n`.

**models**
This is where your app's models will live. Each model has a directory which will contain the `mobx-state-tree` model file, test file, and any other supporting files like actions, types, etc.

**navigators**
This is where your `react-navigation` navigators will live.

**screens**
This is where your screen components will live. A screen is a React component which will take up the entire screen and be part of the navigation hierarchy. Each screen will have a directory containing the `.tsx` file, along with any assets or other helper files.

**services**
Any services that interface with the outside world will live here (think REST APIs, Push Notifications, etc.).

**theme**
Here lives the theme for your application, including spacing, colors, and typography.

**utils**
This is a great place to put miscellaneous helpers and utilities. Things like date helpers, formatters, etc. are often found here. However, it should only be used for things that are truly shared across your application. If a helper or utility is only used by a specific component or model, consider co-locating your helper with that component or model.

**app.tsx** This is the entry point to your app. This is where you will find the main App component which renders the rest of the application.

### ./assets directory

This directory is designed to organize and store various assets, making it easy for you to manage and use them in your application. The assets are further categorized into subdirectories, including `icons` and `images`:

```
assets
├── icons
└── images
```

**icons**
This is where your icon assets will live. These icons can be used for buttons, navigation elements, or any other UI components. The recommended format for icons is PNG, but other formats can be used as well.

Ignite comes with a built-in `Icon` component. You can find detailed usage instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/Components-Icon.md).

**images**
This is where your images will live, such as background images, logos, or any other graphics. You can use various formats such as PNG, JPEG, or GIF for your images.

Another valuable built-in component within Ignite is the `AutoImage` component. You can find detailed usage instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/Components-AutoImage.md).

How to use your `icon` or `image` assets:

```
import { Image } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Image source={require('../assets/images/my_image.png')} />
  );
};
```
